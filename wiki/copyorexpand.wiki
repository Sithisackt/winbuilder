CopyOrExpand

CopyOrExpand,<FileToCopyOrExpand>,<DestinationFolderOrFilename> 
This is a very flexible command that is designed for cases where we can either need to Copy or Expand a file.

It was implemented to ease the task of copying files from Install CD's where often a specified can be present either in normal format or compressed.

These compressed files use the cabinet archiving method and usually have an identifiable _ as the last character on their extensions. (e.g. myFile.Tx_ ). When this file is expanded a new file with a full extension is retrieved.

DestinationFolderOrFilename means that you can either specify a folder where this file will be placed with the original (expanded) filename or new filename that you prefer. 
== Syntax example: ==
CopyOrExpand,c:\MyPath\myTextFile.txt,c:\MyPath\myNewerTextFile.txt

In this example CopyOrExpand will first try to find a file c:\MyPath\myTextFile.txt and if it is not found then it will look for c:\MyPath\myTextFile.tx_ and expand this file if successfully found. WB078 added:
CopyOrExpand gives a warning in the log, if the destination file already exists.
If there is a parameter PRESERVE added, CopyOrExpand of a single file does not overwrite an existing file. A warning is still given
The warning can be suppressed by an additional parameter NOWARN

The parameters PRESERVE, and NOWARN can be used simultaneously. The order does not matter.

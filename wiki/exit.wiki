=Exit=

==Syntax==
{{{
Exit,<exit message>[,NOWARN] 
}}}

This command will force the script to be finished and will make the process continue to the next script on the list.

The "Exit message" is a small text message that is displayed on the log where you can specify the reason why Exit was called.

A warning icon is associated with the log entry but in some conditions, where the exit is intended and a warning icon would confuse the user the NOWARN parameter can be specified to associate an information icon instead.

== Example: == 
{{{
Exit,"File was not found" 
}}}

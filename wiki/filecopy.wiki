=!FileCopy=

Copy source file(s) to a specified destination.

==Syntax==
{{{
FileCopy,<FromFile>,<ToDir>[,PRESERVE][,NOWARN][,SHOW][,NOREC]
}}}

==Parameters==
||1||!FromFile||The file to copy. Wildcards `(*.*)` are allowed.||
||2||!ToDir||The destination directory.||
|| || ||If a filename is specified the file will be renamed.||
|| || ||If the file exists in the target directory it will be overwritten and a warning will be written to the log.||
|| ||PRESERVE _(Optional)_||Do not overwrite existing files. A warning will be written to the log.||
|| ||NOWARN _(Optional)_||Do not write a warning message to the log if the file exists.||
|| ||SHOW _(Optional)_|| When using wildcards the progress bar shows single file processing, and the actual copied file name is shown.|| 
|| || NOREC _(Optional)_||When using wildcards only files in the initial folder will be copied, sub-directories will be ignored.||

==Remarks==
 * The parameters PRESERVE, and NOWARN can be used simultaneously. The order does not matter.
 * When using wildcards the warning mechanism is switched off.
 * Trying to copy wildcard source to a single destination file raises an error.
 * The parameters SHOW and NOREC can be used simultaneously. The order does not matter.

== Example: ==

On this example !FileCopy will copy all text files ({{{*.txt}}}) from !MyPath and it's subdirectories to !AnotherPath (using the C: drive)
{{{
FileCopy,c:\MyPath\*.txt,c:\AnotherPath
}}}

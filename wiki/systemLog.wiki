=System,Log=
{{{
System,Log,{on|off}
}}}
When in your project a certain function is used many, many times, it usually expands inside the log.html into many unnecessary lines.
This command stops / restarts logging to log.html

*It is only in effect for the remainder of the current script!*

==Example: ==
{{{
System,Log,off
}}}

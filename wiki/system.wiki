=Parameters / Sub Commands=

==ReScanScripts==
{{{
System,ReScanScripts
}}}
This will repeat the procedure to find and categorize scripts displayed on the main window. Useful for cases when new custom scripts are created while building a project.

----

==RefreshInterface==
{{{
System,RefreshInterface
}}}
Mostly used on buttons to refresh the script interface with changes, avoiding to make the user re-select again to refresh values.

----



==RefreshVars==
{{{
System,RefreshVars
}}}
If a variable is changed this action performs updating needed for variables that are dependent upon other variables (unnecessary and removed since WB076)

[system Return to Top of Page]

----



==FILEREDIRECT==
{{{
System,FILEREDIRECT,{ON|OFF}
}}}
Maybe necessary when !WinBuilder is running on a 64bit system. Some directory calls are getting redirected by the OS to avoid possible conflicts. Using a 32bit system this command is without effect. 

=== Example: ===
{{{
System,FILEREDIRECT,OFF
ShellExecute,Hide,"cmd.exe","/c imdisk -d -m %FreeLetter%"
System,FILEREDIRECT,ON 
}}}

----



==REGREDIRECT==
{{{
System,REGREDIRECT,{64|32|OFF}
}}}
Maybe necessary when !WinBuilder is running on a 64bit system. Some registry calls are getting redirected by the OS to avoid possible conflicts.
 * 64 causes next accesses to the 64 bit entries.
 * 32 causes next accesses to the 32 bit node.
 * OFF causes Host OS decision
Every definition is valid from "now" to "ever"
Using a 32bit system this command is without effect. 

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,REGREDIRECT,64
RegRead,HKLM,�SOFTWARE\Sun\xVM VirtualBox",InstallDir,%VBPath%
System,REGREDIRECT,OFF
}}}

----




==GetFreeSpace==
{{{
System,GETFREESPACE,<Path>,<%var%>
}}}
Returns the free space of Path's drive in megabytes and puts result into %var%
(megaybtes = free bytes / 1024 * 1024)

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,GETFREESPACE,%BaseDir%,%var%
System,GETFREESPACE,C:,%var%
System,GETFREESPACE,C,%var% Result:
}}}

----



==GetFreeDrive==
{{{
System,GetFreeDrive,<%var%>
}}}
This command returns the highest available free drive letter, Usually the "Z:" drive

----


==ERROROFF==
{{{
System,ERROROFF[,lines] 
}}}
This command causes that a script processing error is not marked as an error and therefore !Winbuilder will continue to process the scripts.

By default this functionality is valid for the next script line. That can be changed by defining the optional number of lines.

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,ERROROFF
RegRead,HKLM,"CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\Application\VMware Virtual Mount Service Extended",EventMessageFile,%VMtmp%
If,NOT,EXISTVAR,%VMtmp%,Begin
System,ERROROFF,2
RegRead,HKCR,Wow6432Node\Applications\vmware-mount.exe\shell\Mount\command,,%VMtmp%
If,NOT,EXISTVAR,%VMtmp%,RegRead,HKCR,Applications\vmware-mount.exe\shell\Mount\command,,%VMtmp% 
}}}

----


==ONSCRIPTEXIT==
{{{
System,ONSCRIPTEXIT,<Command> 
}}}
This statement can be written anywhere inside the running part of a script.
It will be executed after the last script's statement has been executed.

If command is 'Run' as parameter #1 the 'type' of the exit is passed
 * DONE - normal finish
 * STOP - the user clicked the STOP button
 * ERROR - the script has been finished because of an error
 * COMMAND - the script has been finished because of a System,Halt or System,Exit command
 * EXCEPTION - a system exception occurred during process, e.g. 'index out of bounds'

=== Example: ===
{{{
System,ONSCRIPTEXIT,Message,"Everything Done!",INFORMATION 
}}}

{{{
System,ONSCRIPTEXIT,Run,%ScriptFile%,MYEXIT
// force an error:
FileCopy,y,x

[MYEXIT]
If,#1,EQUAL,ERROR,Beep,ERROR
If,#1,EQUAL,STOP,Beep,WARNING
If,#1,EQUAL,DONE,Beep,OK
If,#1,EQUAL,COMMAND,Beep,CONFIRMATION 
}}}

----

==ONBUILDEXIT==
{{{
System,ONBuildEXIT,Command
}}}
This statement can be written anywhere inside the running part of a script. Always the last executed statement is valid.
So different scripts can define different actions or deactivate with {{{System,ONBUILDEXIT}}}

It will be executed after the last script in the project has been processed. More examples in [ONSCRIPTEXIT System,ONSCRIPTEXIT]

----

==REBUILDVARS==
{{{
System,REBUILDVARS
}}}
This is a successor of System,RefreshVars, which since WB076 in most cases is not more necessary.

=== Example: === 
{{{
Set,%First%,first
Set,%Result%,"Here is %first%"
Echo,Value of #$pResult#$p is: %Result%
// >> Here is first
Set,%First%,second
Echo,Value of #$pResult#$p is: %Result%
// >> Here is first
System,RebuildVars
Echo,Value of #$pResult#$p is: %Result%
// >> Here is second 
}}}

----

==GETENV==
{{{
System,GETENV,<EnvironmentVariable>,%var%
}}}
Gets the value of a system ENV variable - NOTE, the name of the {{{<EnvironmentVariable>}}} *must not* be enclosed in percent!

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,GETENV,Temp,%var%
Echo,%var%
}}}

[system Return to Top of Page]

----

==ISADMIN==
{{{
System,ISADMIN,%var%
}}}
Sets %var% to True or False, depending on whether !WinBuilder has been started by an admin.


[system Return to Top of Page]

----

==Cursor==
{{{
System,CURSOR,{WAIT|NORMAL}
}}}
Sets the system cursor as hourglass or the default cursor.


[system Return to Top of Page]

----

==SAVELOG==
{{{
System,SAVELOG,<OutputFile>
}}}
Saves the actual accumulated log to `<OutputFile>`. `<OutputFile>` should have the extention '.html' (since !Winbuilder writes out the log in html syntax for easy viewing in a web browser - i.e. uses color coding as well as internal page links to provide navigation.

Usefull for debugginp purposes - i.e. When a build creates a reproducible hang in a certain script, you can save the log before or in the beginning of this script.


[system Return to Top of Page]

----

==SPLITPARAMETERS==
{{{
System,SPLITPARAMETERS,{ON|OFF}
}}}
Splits in a 'Run' or 'Exec' command a single parameter which contains commas, into several parameters.

The {{{System,SPLITPARAMETERS,ON}}} command can be given once in the project, e.g. in [Process] of script.project, and is then valid for the complete project (or until it is switched off by a {{{System,SPLITPARAMETERS,OFF}}} command.  It can then be switched on again later, and off, and so on ....) 

=== Example: === 
{{{
[process]
Set,%List%,"a,b,c"
Run,%ScriptFile%,Test,%List%
System,SPLITPARAMETERS,ON
Run,%ScriptFile%,Test,%List%
System,SPLITPARAMETERS,OFF

[Test]
Echo,#1
Echo,#2
Echo,#3
}}}

This creates a log file result:
{{{
Processing section: [process] 
File [%BaseDir%\Projects\win7_pe\CodeBox.txt] Version [1]
SetVar - Sucessfuly changed the value of [%List%] to: [a#$cb#$cc]
Run - Processing section: [Test] From file: [%BaseDir%\Projects\win7_pe\CodeBox.txt]
with parameters: [a,b,c]
a,b,c


Run - Processed section [Test] in file: [%BaseDir%\Projects\win7_pe\CodeBox.txt]
System,SplitParameters,ON
Run - Processing section: [Test] From file: [%BaseDir%\Projects\win7_pe\CodeBox.txt]
with parameters: [a],[b],[c]
a
b
c
Run - Processed section [Test] in file: [%BaseDir%\Projects\win7_pe\CodeBox.txt]
System,SplitParameters,OFF
}}}

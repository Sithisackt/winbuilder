#summary If Question

=Question=

Asks the user a question, and uses their response to determine if the command should be executed. Note: all strings defined in the language files can be used like variables, identified by their ID number $#nnnn.

==Syntax==
{{{
If,QUESTION,<Question>,<Command>
}}}

==Remarks==
Usually the question dialog waits for the user's input. Using these optional parameters, you can cause to close it after a timeout ( and supply a default response), by adding the timeout (in seconds) and a default answer (Yes / No) as last arguments. 
{{{
If,QUESTION,"Exit Script?",Exit,"User decided",10,yes
}}}

== Example: == 
{{{
If,QUESTION,$#1541?,command 
}}}
Here, we are using an internal string to display a question (The question mark is part of the TEXT, not part of the ID!). The resulting dialog box shows in case of default language (English):
{{{
Save changes to disk?
}}}
In case of e.g. italian language:
{{{
Salva cambiamenti al disco?
}}}

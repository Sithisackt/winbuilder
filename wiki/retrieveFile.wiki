 * You can specify the path to use and filter the accepted extensions or filenames to be accepted
 * %var% is a user defined variable containing the full path of the selected filename

 This example will open a dialog box asking the user to select a file. This box will start in `c:\` and will only display files that match the filter criteria which is `*.txt` in this example. Once a file is selected, the %var% will contain the full filename of this selected file.

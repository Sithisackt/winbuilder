=System,!RegRedirect==
{{{
System,REGREDIRECT,{64|32|OFF}
}}}
Maybe necessary when !WinBuilder is running on a 64bit system. Some registry calls are getting redirected by the OS to avoid possible conflicts.
 * 64 causes next accesses to the 64 bit entries.
 * 32 causes next accesses to the 32 bit node.
 * OFF causes Host OS decision
Every definition is valid from "now" to "ever"
Using a 32bit system this command is without effect. 

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,REGREDIRECT,64
RegRead,HKLM,SOFTWARE\Sun\xVM VirtualBox",InstallDir,%VBPath%
System,REGREDIRECT,OFF
}}}

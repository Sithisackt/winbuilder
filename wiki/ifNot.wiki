#summary If Not
=Not=

This syntax was introduced to simplify the addition of future conditions.  It basically changes the "sense" of the check from true to false. 
 In other words, the statement `If,Not,%var1%,EQUAL,%var2%,command` is equivalent to `If,%var1%,NOTEQUAL,%var2%,command`.
{{{
If,Not,<Condition>,<Command>
}}}

== Example: == 
{{{
If,Not,%var1%,EQUAL,%var2%,FileCreateBlank,C:\myFile.txt
}}}

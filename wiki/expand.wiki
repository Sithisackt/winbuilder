Expand

Expand,<CABfile>,<DirToDecompress> 
This command will decompress all files inside CABfile to the folder you specify.

Cabinet files usually use extension .CAB

== Syntax example: ==
Expand,c:\MyPath\MyFile.cab,c:\MyNewPath

In this example Expand will try to expand all files found inside c:\MyPath\MyFile.cab to the folder c:\MyNewPath
WB078 added:
A single file can be extracted from the cab file, by giving it's name as third parameter

== Syntax example: ==
Expand,c:\MyPath\MyFile.cab,c:\MyNewPath,YourFile.dll

Expand of a single file gives a warning in the log, if the destination file already exists.
If there is a parameter PRESERVE added, Expand of a single file does not overwrite an existing file. A warning is still given
The warning can be suppressed by an additional parameter NOWARN

The parameters PRESERVE, and NOWARN can be used simultaneously. The order does not matter.

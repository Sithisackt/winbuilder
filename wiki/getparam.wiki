=Getparam=
==Syntax==
{{{
GetParam,Index,%Var%
}}}
This command writes the parameter at the given index position int *%var%*.  This is needed when dealing with more than 9 passed parameters using the [run Run or Exec] commands.

This is because normally, the parameters are access by only a single digit following the "#" (hash mark) character.  Given the "fixed formatting", a different process was needed to access the values of any greater parameter.

This is also an easy way to make script files more readable, since it allows you to assign a more meaningful variable name to the parameters being passed into the section.

==Example:==
{{{
GetParam,10,%Variable_Ten
}}}

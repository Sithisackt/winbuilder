=System,!ErrorOff==
{{{
System,ERROROFF[,lines] 
}}}
This command causes that a script processing error is not marked as an error and therefore !Winbuilder will continue to process the scripts.

By default this functionality is valid for the next script line. That can be changed by defining the optional number of lines.

=== Example: === 
{{{
System,ERROROFF
RegRead,HKLM,"CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\Application\VMware Virtual Mount Service Extended",EventMessageFile,%VMtmp%
If,NOT,EXISTVAR,%VMtmp%,Begin
System,ERROROFF,2
RegRead,HKCR,Wow6432Node\Applications\vmware-mount.exe\shell\Mount\command,,%VMtmp%
If,NOT,EXISTVAR,%VMtmp%,RegRead,HKCR,Applications\vmware-mount.exe\shell\Mount\command,,%VMtmp% 
}}}

=!FolderSize=
==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,FolderSize,<Directory>,<%var%> 
}}}

This function is used to calculate the size of a folder and store it inside a variable.
 * Directory is the target directory
 * %var% is the stored value (expressed in bytes)

=!FileSize=

==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,FileSize,<Filename>,<%var%> 
}}}
This function is used to calculate the size of a folder and store it inside a variable.
 * Filename is the target file
 * %var% is the stored value (expressed in bytes)

== Syntax example: ==
{{{
Retrieve,FolderSize,c:\myFolder,%var%
}}}

----
=File=
==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,File,<Filename>,<%var%> 
}}}
This function will display a dialog box asking the user to select a filename. Once a value is selected and the user clicks "Ok" to close the box, this value will be stored inside %var%
 * You can specify the path to use and filter the accepted extensions or filenames to be accepted
 * %var% is the stored value of the selected filename

== Example: ==
 This example will open a dialog box asking the user to select a file. This box will start in `c:\` and will only display files that match the filter criteria which is `*.txt` on this case. Once a file is selected, the %var% will contain the full filename of this selected file. 
{{{
Retrieve,File,c:\*.txt,%var%
}}}

<br>
----
=Dir=

==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,File/Dir,<DirectoryOrFilename>,<%var%> 
}}}
This function will display a dialog box asking the user to select a folder. Once a value is selected and the user clicks "Ok" to close the box, this value will be stored inside %var%
 * You can specify where the initially selected folder is placed.
 * %var% isï¿½the stored value of the selected filename or foldername

== Syntax example: ==
 You can use this example to open a dialog box asking the user to select a folder. This box will start in `c:\`. Once a file is selected, the %var% will contain the full pathname of this selected directory. 
{{{
Retrieve,Dir,c:\,%var%
}}}

----
=MD5=

==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,MD5,<Filename>,<%var%> 
}}}
MD5 is a way to calculate a number known as a 'hash' or 'checksum' that is based on the content of a file.

It is used as a safety check to ensure that files are complete and unmodified when they are downloaded from a server. You can also call this function to ensure that your files were not modified. 

== Example: ==
 This function will write the value of the MD5 result on %var%, you can compare against a security value written elsewhere to prove that your file is intact.
{{{
Retrieve,MD5,c:\MyText.txt,%var%
}}}

=!FileVersion=

==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,FILEVERSION,<Filename>,<%var%>
}}}
== Example: == 
 This example fills %var% with the file version string, as it can be seen by EXE-file's properties.
{{{
Retrieve,FILEVERSION,"c:\Program Files\IrfanView\i_view32.exe",%var%
}}}

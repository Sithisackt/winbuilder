AddVariables

AddVariables,<%ScriptFile%>,<Section>
Use this command to add more variables to the script based on the entries found inside another section from any script file.
When a script is started it will read the [variables] section, during the script processing you can repeat this procedure and read the variables found inside any section you wish to use.
Use %scriptfile% to read a section from the same file from where this command is called.
Older variables with the same designation are overwritten with newer values.
== Syntax example: == AddVariables,%scriptFile%,AlternativeVariables 

WB076 added: There is an additional optional parameter possible:
GLOBAL: If this parameter is set, the additional variables will be known through the complete build.

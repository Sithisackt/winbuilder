=!AddVariables=

{{{
AddVariables,<%ScriptFile%>,<Section>,[GLOBAL]
}}}

Use this command to add more variables to the script based on the entries found inside another section from any script file.

==Tips==
 * When a script is started it will read the `[variables]` section, but using this command during the script processing, you can repeat this procedure and read the variables found inside any section you wish to use.
 * Use %scriptfile% to read a section from the same file from where this command is called.
 * Older variables with the same designation are overwritten with newer values.
 * If the optional parameter ( *{{{GLOBAL}}}*) is specified, the additional variables will be known through the complete build.

== Example: == 
{{{
AddVariables,%scriptFile%,AlternativeVariables 
}}}

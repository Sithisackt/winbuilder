=!ExtractAndRun=

Extract a file that is attached (encoded) inside a script to a temporary location, run the file, and then delete it. 

==Syntax==
{{{
ExtractAndRun,<%ScriptFile%>,<Folder>,<Filename>[,<parameters>] 
}}}

Optional run parameters can be defined. They must not contain spaces, quotes or commas. Use the escaped form of these characters (i.e. {{{ #$s, #$q, #$c}}} ) instead.

It is useful when you only wish to run a file for a very specific purpose and this way avoid having to add extra commands to 
 # extract
 # run and then 
 # delete 
the file from a temporary location when it is no longer needed.

== Example: ==

Using this syntax we will extract myApp.exe to a temporary location and then delete this file when it has finished running.
{{{
ExtractAndRun,C:\myFile.script,Folder,myApp.exe 
}}}

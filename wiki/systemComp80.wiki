 * Use this command to force compatability with winbuilder version 80. WB 082 is in some situations incompatible with WB 080 because of the way that variables are treated internally.
 * With System,Comp80,ON or System,Comp80,OFF you can make the current WB script processing (mostly) compatible to the processing of WB 080.
 * *When starting WB 082, by default the compatibility is switched off.*
 * If compatability is set to off then scripts are processed 2 to 3 times faster.

===Example: ===
{{{
System,Comp80,off
}}}

=System,!OnBuildExit=
{{{
System,OnBuildEXIT,Command
}}}
This statement can be written anywhere inside the running part of a script. Always the last executed statement is valid.
So different scripts can define different actions or deactivate with {{{System,ONBUILDEXIT}}}

It will be executed after the last script in the project has been processed. More examples in [systemONSCRIPTEXIT System,ONSCRIPTEXIT]

=!RegRead=

==Syntax ==
{{{
RegRead,<HKEY>,<Section>,<Key>,<%Variable%> 
}}}
This command will read a value from the key you specify.

It uses the same components as described in the other registry commands with the difference that it will read the value of a key and write it into a variable.

This command will only retrieve values from the following keytypes:
 * 0x1 - String
 * 0x3 - Integer
 * 0x4 - Binary

==WB078 added:==
All key types are supported now.

== Example: ==
{{{
RegRead,HKLM,Build\ControlSet001\Services\VgaSave\Device0,DefaultSettings.XResolution,%myXresolution% 
}}}
In this example the variable %myXresolution% will store the value of the mentioned key

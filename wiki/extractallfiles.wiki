=ExtractAllFiles=

==Syntax==
{{{
ExtractAllFiles,<%ScriptFile%>,<Folder>,<DirToExtract> 
}}}
This command will extract all files from a given folder inside a script.

Uses the same syntax as the [extractfile ExtractFile] command which can be used to extract a single file, but with the advantage that you can extract all files from a folder without needing to specify individual filenames. 

== Eexample ==
Using this example we will extract all files found inside a folder in a given script file to c:\
{{{
ExtractAllFiles,C:\myFile.script,Folder,c:\ 
}}}

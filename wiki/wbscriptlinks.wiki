Script Link Files
The winbuilder scripting API provides two mechanisms to add links to external script files into a project.

The first allows a link to an external folder to be specified. This is done by creating a file named folder.project in a folder. This file should contain a links section which specifies the external folder name containing the scripts to be imported. All scripts in the specified folder and any sub-folders will be added to the folder containing the folder.project file. If any linked scripts are disabled then the script will also be disabled in the source project. An example folder.project is:

[Links]
Projects\Gena-Complete\*.* 

The second mecanism uses a file with an extension of link to link a particular script file into the same directory as the link file. If the script is disabled in the link file then this only affects the script in the project containing the link file. The original source script is left unchanged. Of course if interface options are changed this affects both projects. An example link file is:

[Main]
link=Projects\Addons\AccessGainDrivers.script
Selected=True

=Link Files=

The !WinBuilder scripting API provides two mechanisms to add links to allow it to reference external script files as a part of more than one project.

==`folder.project`=
The first allows a link to an external folder to be specified. This is done by creating a file named folder.project in a projects folder. This file should contain a links section which specifies the external folder name containing the scripts to be imported. 

All scripts in the specified folder and any sub-folders will be added to the folder containing the folder.project file. If any linked scripts are disabled then the script will also be disabled in the source project. 

An example folder.project is:
{{{
[Links]
Projects\Gena-Complete\*.* 
}}}

==`<script>.link`==
The second mechanism uses a file with an extension of `.link` to link a particular script file into the same directory as the link file. If the script is disabled in the link file then this only affects the script in the project containing the link file. 

In other words, the original source script is left unchanged. Of course if interface options are changed this affects both projects. 

An example link file is:
{{{
[Main]
link=Projects\Addons\AccessGainDrivers.script
Selected=True
}}}

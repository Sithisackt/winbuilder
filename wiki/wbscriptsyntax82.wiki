=File Handling=
==!FileDelete==
{{{
FileDelete,<FileToDelete> [,Nowarn,Norec]
}}}
*New optional Nowarn, Norec parameter added*

This command will delete files. It uses Win32 API as a silent operation deleting all files that match the search criteria. You can view the result of this operation on the respective log entry. Beware that all deleted files are *immediately removed* instead of being moved to the recycle bin.

FileDelete supports wildcards ( *.* )
 * If wild cards are specified then, unless Norec is specified, any files matching the wild card will also be deleted _*in subdirectories*_ of the specified directory. 
 * If Norec is specified then only matching files in the specified directory will be deleted.
 * By default if the specified file does not exist or if no files match the wild card then a warning will be put into the log file. 
 * If NoWarn is specified then this warning log is suppressed.
 * The optional Nowarn and Norec parameters can be specified in any order.

=== Example: ===
{{{
FileDelete,c:\MyPath\*.txt,NoWarn,Norec
}}}
In this example !FileDelete will delete all text files (`*`.txt) from the !MyPath directory only. If no files are found no warning will be added to the log file.

=Miscellaneous Commands=
* Exit - optional Nowarn parameter added 
* System,Comp80 - sets winbuilder 80 compatibility
* System,HasUAC - sets a variable indicating if Vista / Win7 UAC is enabled
* System,IsTerminal - sets a variable indicating if running under terminal server ( remote desktop ) 
* System,Log - controls logging to log file

==Exit==
{{{
Exit,<exit message>[,Nowarn]
}}}
Since there are conditions, where the exit is intended, and a warning icon would confuse the user, the `NOWARN` parameter was added. If the NOWARN option is specified then an information icon is associated with the message in the log.

===Example: ===
Exit,"Script is disabled for this source",Nowarn

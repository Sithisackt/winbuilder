=System,!FileRedirect=
{{{
System,FILEREDIRECT,{ON|OFF}
}}}
Maybe necessary when !WinBuilder is running on a 64bit system. Some directory calls are getting redirected by the OS to avoid possible conflicts. Using a 32bit system this command is without effect. 

=== Example: ===
{{{
System,FILEREDIRECT,OFF
ShellExecute,Hide,"cmd.exe","/c imdisk -d -m %FreeLetter%"
System,FILEREDIRECT,ON 
}}}

=!DirDelete=

Delete the entire contents of a directory. Deleted folders are not recoverable from the recycle bin.

==Syntax==
{{{
DirDelete,<DirToDelete>[,FAST]
}}}

== Example: ==
{{{
DirDelete,c:\MyPath
}}}

==WB076==
Added the optional *`FAST`* parameter. When used, Winbuilder will rename the directory to a random name, and then execute the delete process in the background.  This can improve performance when removing directories that have a large number of files in them.

*REMEMBER* - The background RD (remove direcotry) is a child of WinBuiler. When ( or *IF* ) WinBuilder is exited before the delete is finished, the background RD is exited, too, and may leave a directory with a name like `~<???>.tmp` left behind.  If this happens, just manually delete this directory.

=Retrieve,MD5=

==Syntax==
{{{
Retrieve,MD5,<Filename>,<%var%> 
}}}
MD5 is a way to calculate a number known as a 'hash' or 'checksum' that is based on the content of a file.

It is used as a safety check to ensure that files are complete and unmodified when they are downloaded from a server. You can also call this function to ensure that your files were not modified. 

== Example: ==
This function will write the value of the MD5 result on %var%, you can compare against a security value written elsewhere to prove that your file is intact.
{{{
Retrieve,MD5,c:\MyText.txt,%var%
}}}

==1==

*Issue:* The code editor has a column limit of 1024 characters. [http://reboot.pro/15569/page__pid__138997#entry138997 [Bug Report]]


*Workaround:* the Winbuilder engine itself is quite happy to read beyond the limit when processing the script so processing is not affected. One must just use another text editor such as notepad to modify the script. 


*Remarks:* This limit will be raised to 10240 in the next release (WB83-WB84)

*Issue:* Bug with [getparam  GetParam] [http://reboot.pro/15223/page__view__findpost__p__135483 [Forum Topic]]

*Workaround:* Use string format 
{{{
[process]
Run,%ScriptFile%,Pack,1,2,something with space,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13
[pack]
PackParam,1,%packed%
GetParam,3,%Value%
Echo,%Value%
StrFormat,SPLIT,%packed%,#$c,3,%Value%
Echo,%Value%
}}}

*Remarks:* Fixed in a future WB release (WB83-WB84)

*Issue:* Sometimes text labels do not show up or check boxes disappear when using themes other than "Windows Classic" [http://reboot.pro/14856/page__hl__%2Bdisable+%2Bvisual+%2Bthemes__fromsearch__1 [Development Topic]]

*Workaround:* Use the windows classic them or disable Visual Styles in the Compatibility options for Winbuilder.exe

*Remarks:* This is a known issue with the current Delphi 7 compiler.

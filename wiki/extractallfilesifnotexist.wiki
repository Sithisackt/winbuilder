=ExtractAllFilesIfNotExist=

==Syntax==
{{{
ExtractAllFilesIfNotExist,<%ScriptFile%>,<Folder>,<DirToExtract> 
}}}
This command uses the same syntax as [extractallfiles ExtractAllFiles] with the difference that it will _*only*_ extract files from a folder of the specified script if they aren't already found in {{{DirToExtract}}}

It was added to support cases where it is required to extract only newer files and keep the older ones unchanged

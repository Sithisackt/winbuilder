= Common API=

===The "common" API is a means to extend and add functionality to a !WinBuilder project. It's purpose was to make application (and other) scripts more compatible across multiple projects.===

===The current API project is still in a bit of "flux", however most commands have been around for some time and will continue to be supported in future versions.===

===A process to better manage the API and put it under tighter version control is *_under development._*===
